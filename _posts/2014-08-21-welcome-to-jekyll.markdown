Over the summer, I worked on the [Debian Continuous Integration project](http://ci.debian.net) under my mentor Antonio Terceiro
as part of the Google Summer of Code.

My project involved improving the web interface of debci. I had to implement support for multiple suites and
architectures, reduce the dependency the UI had on Javascript, and provide more information to package maintainers.

Expect more information here soon...
