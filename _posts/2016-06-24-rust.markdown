## Updates

It's been a while since I wrote the first part of this series.

Over the past few weeks I have been working on getting basic navigation working
on the keyboard with `TAB` and `SHIFT`+`TAB`. Navigation currently works, although there are a few bugs.

Some of the hardest problems that I faced so far were getting the elements in
the page added in the right order, specifically tree order, but I found in
the Servo documentation that there is a method to traverse the DOM tree in
preorder. Pretty useful!

## Navigating Web Pages

The results of the work are shown below. The GIF below shows me navigating
Wikipedia links using the keyboard.

Wikipedia also has an autofocus element on the main page, which makes the focus
ordering list not entirely correct. So, the code will have to handle autofocus
in future updates.

## Next Steps

These were the initial steps to get keyboard navigation supported. Next,
the implementation needs to be brought up to spec, as defined by WHATWG.

Until next time.
