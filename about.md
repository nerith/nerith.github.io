I am a Computer Science undergraduate student and FOSS enthusiast with an interest in system administration, FOSS software development, and *nix systems, especially GNU/Linux.

I am experienced in several programming languages such as C, Java, Python, and Ruby and I have a tendency to dabble in theoretical Computer Science
from time to time.
