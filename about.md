Computer Science undergraduate student. I am a FOSS enthusiast with an interest in system administration, FOSS software development, and everything Linux.

I am experienced in several programming languages such as C, Java, Python, and Ruby and have a tendency to dabble in theoretical Computer Science
from time to time.
