I am a Computer Science undergraduate student and
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software'>FOSS</a>
enthusiast with an interest in system administration, FOSS software development,
and *nix systems, especially GNU/Linux.

I am experienced in several programming languages such as C, Java, Python, and Ruby and I have a tendency to dabble in theoretical Computer Science
from time to time.

### IRC
