I am a Computer Science undergraduate student and
[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
enthusiast with an interest in system administration, FOSS software development,
the web, and *nix systems, especially GNU/Linux. My current FOSS work is focused
on [debci](https://ci.debian.net).

I am experienced in several programming languages such as C, Java, Python, and
Ruby and I have a tendency to dabble in theoretical Computer Science from time
to time.

### On the Web

  * I am `nerith` on `irc.oftc.net` and `irc.freenode.net`.

  * [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}) holds most of my
    free software and open source work.
