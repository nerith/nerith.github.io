title: About Me
---

I am a software developer and free software enthusiast.

Throughout my studies I have found that I enjoy both low-level and high-level Computer Science topics. I currently enjoy computer networking, web and tool programming, and low-level coding.

In my spare time, I like to tinker with Unix and Unix-like systems and contribute to free and open source software.

Software that I create and contribute to is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nerith).
