title: About Me
---

I am a software developer and free software enthusiast.

Throughout my studies I have found that I enjoy both low-level and high-level Computer Science topics. I currently enjoy computer networking, web and tool programming, and low-level coding.

In my spare time, I like to tinker with Unix and Unix-like systems and contribute to free and open source software.

I have recently graduated from university and am currently seeking a job in software development. If you are seeking someone to fill a software development position, feel free to contact me using the information below.
